# Youtube Googlebot Spoofer
An extension for Chromium browsers that spoofs the user-agent on youtube.com to googlebot.

As of June 2020, this may possibly be the only way to restore the much faster classic YouTube design.
Don't rely too much on this extension, as this trick may stop working at any time.
The website may possibly break, or break partly at any time. **The old design is unsupported, so don't bother the YouTube developers with support questions!**

As a bonus, this extension also restores the broken video description for now.

I recommended that you remove any other extensions or userscripts that claims to restore the old YT design before installing this extension.

### How to install

- Clone or download this repository.
- Unpack the extension if you downloaded it instead of cloning it.
- Go to chromium/chrome *Extensions*.
- Click to check *Developer mode*.
- Click *Load unpacked extension...*.
- In the file selector dialog:
    - Select the directory `youtube-googlebot-spoofer` that was cloned/downloaded.
    - Click *Open*.
